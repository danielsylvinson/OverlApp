# OverlApp
A simple tool to compute extent of spatial overlap associated with electronic transitions based on natural transition orbitals (NTOs)

The extent of overlap (Λ) associated with the electronic transition from the ground state to the S1 state was computed using the natural transition orbitals (NTOs) according to the following expression:

\[\mathit{\Lambda}=\ \frac{\sum_k{{\sigma }_k}\int{\left|{}^e_k{\phi }\right|\ \left|{}^h_k{\phi }\right|\ d\tau }}{\sum_k{{\sigma }_k}}\] 

where, (_k^e)ϕ and (_k^h)ϕ are the electron and hole NTO pairs and σ_k is the amplitude of the corresponding NTO pair.
